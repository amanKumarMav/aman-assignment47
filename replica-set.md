# Write a common use-case, where you will use a daemon set instead of replica set.
   1. Daemon set is used instead of replica set when we need to get some analytics data.
   2. Ex: - running daemon set for logs collections on every node.
          - running daemon set for monitoring on every node.
          real example - task manager in Windows
